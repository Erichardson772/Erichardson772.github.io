## Welcome to my live web page

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

I have to assume this is what the lab meant when it said to use jakll

```markdown

- Bulleted
- List
- this 
- is 
  - all 
  - one list

1. Numbered
2. List
3. keep going  
  4.  and can indent  
  5.  like unordered 

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Erichardson772/Erichardson772.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
